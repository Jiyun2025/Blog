#### basic notion
 
**1️⃣ Supervised Learning** is a type of machine learning where the model learns from <ins>labeled data</ins>.
> 
>The algorithm is trained on input-output pairs where the output is known.
> 
> ex) Image classification, spam detection, predicting house prices,Fraud detection, medical diagnosis, sentiment analysis and loan default prediction.
- Supervised Learning is best for making predictions when labels are available.



**2️⃣ Unsupervised Learning** is a type of machine learning where the model learns from <ins>unlabeled data</ins>.
> 
>The algorithm finds patterns, structures, or relationships in the data without predefined labels.
> 
> ex)To discover hidden patterns, structures, Customer segmentation, anomaly detection, topic modeling and relationships within the data.
- Unsupervised Learning helps in exploratory analysis when labels are unknown.

 
**3️⃣ Reinforcement learning** <ins>teaches an agent</ins> to make decisions through trial and error to maximize rewards.
> To find the optimal policy (or strategy) that maximizes cumulative rewards over time.
> ex) Game playing (e.g., AlphaGo), robotics, self-driving cars, and resource management.
